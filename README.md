**CimpleAI**

This is a small project to learn a bit about C and AI. The idea is to have a command line tool that can evolve neural networks. A more detailed documentation will follow. The current main method tries to evolve a network, that adds up two numbers.

**Setup/Compiling**

On linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
gcc main.c neural_network.c -o out.o
./out.o
```
